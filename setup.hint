sdesc: "File de/compressor based on LZMA algorithm"
ldesc: "Lzip is a lossless data compressor based on the LZMA algorithm, 
with very safe integrity checking and a user interface similar to the 
one of gzip or bzip2. Lzip decompresses almost as fast as gzip and 
compresses better than bzip2, which makes it well suited for software 
distribution and data archiving."
